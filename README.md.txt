# Handwritten Digit Recognition (MNIST)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that classifies handwritten digits (0â€“9) using the MNIST dataset.  
It achieves **~98% accuracy** and supports prediction from custom user-uploaded images.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Train CNN model on MNIST dataset
- Predict digits from images uploaded by the user
- High accuracy on unseen test data

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- Pillow (PIL) for image handling
